The Great E-commerce Exodus (Or How Our Load Balancer Took an Unscheduled Coffee Break)
Issue Summary:
Duration: The Great E-commerce Exodus hit us like a caffeine withdrawal on November 15, 2023, starting at 10:45 AM UTC and playing hide-and-seek with our servers until 12:45 PM UTC.
Impact: Our e-commerce platform temporarily turned into a snail with a limp, causing a 30% degradation in user experience. Transactions were as successful as trying to teach a cat to fetch, with a 20% failure rate reported by our resilient users.
Root Cause: Our load balancing system went on a coffee break, redirecting traffic like a GPS with a sense of adventure. The culprit? A misconfiguration decided to spice things up during routine maintenance, making one server feel like the prom queen while others were stuck wallowing in self-pity.
Timeline:
10:45 AM UTC: Picture this - November 15, 2023. Our monitoring system threw a tantrum, screaming about increased error rates.
10:48 AM UTC: Our automated monitoring, basically the nosy neighbor of the IT world, spotted a surge in 5xx HTTP error codes and latency that even a sloth would find unacceptable.
10:50 AM UTC - 11:30 AM UTC:
Like detectives in a crime movie, we delved into application logs, discovering the servers were having an uninvited party.
We thought it might be a DDoS attack and put our firewalls on a diet with rate limiting.
Checked network issues, and even interrogated the CDN configurations for potential mischief.
11:30 AM UTC - 12:15 PM UTC:
Initially, we were convinced it was a DDoS attack. Spoiler alert: It wasnâ€™t.
Spent more time investigating CDN settings than we'd like to admit.
12:15 PM UTC: Sent out the IT Bat-Signal, calling in the DevOps and Networking heroes, as the situation seemed more complicated than a relationship status on Facebook.
12:30 PM UTC: Found the load balancing system playing favorites and directed it back to fairness.
12:45 PM UTC: Implemented a restart party for our application servers to sober them up.
Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The load balancing system got confused during its morning coffee, and a configuration file got swapped like trading cards at recess.
Resolution: We sent the load balancing system to therapy (reverted the config to a stable version), and added automated checks to make sure it doesn't pull a stunt like this again.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
Configuration Management: Adding a personal trainer for our configurations - version control and automated validation checks.
Monitoring Enhancements: Our monitoring is leveling up, becoming Sherlock Holmes with more detailed insights into traffic distribution and server health.
Load Testing: Turning our servers into gym enthusiasts with regular load testing to catch potential issues before they hit the treadmill.
Tasks:
Task 1: Configuration Rollback Procedure: Preparing a documented and rehearsed "Configuration CPR" for swift rollbacks. (Deadline: November 22, 2023)
Task 2: Load Balancer Redundancy: Considering introducing a stunt double for our load balancing system to avoid a single point of failure. (Deadline: December 1, 2023)
Task 3: User Communication Plan: Creating a "Service Oopsie Daisy" plan to keep our users in the loop during future hiccups. (Deadline: November 18, 2023)
This postmortem is not just a tale of technical turbulence but a blockbuster movie with configurations, conspiracies, and a dash of humor to keep the audience entertained. Because who said IT couldn't be a stand-up comedy?
